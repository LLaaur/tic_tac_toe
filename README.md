# tic_tac_toe

Tic Tac Toe browser game made with HTML CSS and JS.

Really hit a wall with this one but managed to finish it after all.

Things I learned: 

I. How to write code using the pattern module.

II. Better grasp at pointer events (e).

III. Using factory functions.

IV. Associate arrays with DOM elements.

V. Using IIFE (Immediately invoked functions expresions).
